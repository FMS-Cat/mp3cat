# mp3-server

**I HATE ITUNES**

- Can access from anywhere via browser
- Can stream / download library
- Can search so fast using mongodb
- Can add any file and convert into mp3
- Can modify metadata
  - Can read comment as json!! (important)
- Can authorize users by twitter authorization
- And it is working on RasPi3

(wip)
